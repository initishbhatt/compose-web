## What is Jetpack Compose

[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) is a modern toolkit designed to simplify UI development. It combines a reactive programming model with the conciseness and ease of use of the Kotlin programming language. It is fully declarative, meaning you describe your UI by calling a series of functions that transform data into a UI hierarchy. When the underlying data changes, the framework automatically recalls these functions, updating the view hierarchy for you.
